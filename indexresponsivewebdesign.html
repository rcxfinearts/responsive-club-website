<h4>
About MUSE.
</h4>
<p>
MUSE. was founded by artists with a passion for all music types with a desire to challenge stereotypes surrounding the industry.
The goal of this club is to blend genres through open collaboration and objectively deliberate the feeling, lyrics, of every song.
Music is not a skin color, not a gender, not a geographical region, not only for 'certain people' or 'certain styles'.
Music is FREE.
